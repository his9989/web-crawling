# web crawling

I study this code in 한경 bigdata social marketing study last winter .

1. 형태소 분석 & 워드클라우드 : this code could extract nouns(or sentences, pos etc) in txt.file.
                              and then it could make word cloud. we could choose word cloud's shape and color.
                              
2. 인스타그램 매크로 : this code have three functions.
                     first. it could "like" for your time line posts.
                     second. it could search something hash-tag, and could "like" for their posts.
                     third. it could visit and "like" who "liked" for your posts.
                     
3. 네이버 카페 웹 크롤러 : this code search something key-word, and could take post's "title", "content", "comments"
                         ex) if you want every post's data that key-word is "수학" in "수만휘" naver cafe,
                             this code could take post's "title", "content", "comments".
